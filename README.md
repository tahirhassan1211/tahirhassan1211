## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Tahir Hassan

## About Me
**I'm a passionate Machine Learning and Generative AI developer focused on building scalable and impactful solutions using the latest AI technologies. In 2024, I completed MS in Data Science from NED University of Engineering and Technology, along with two research publications in IEEE international conferences. Before that, I had completed a BS in Computer Science from FAST National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences. I had completed a  4-month bootcamp program on Artificial Intelligence organized by the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication. I achieved a Generative AI Developers Certificate from Pak Angels Silicon Valley, USA. 



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on research projects related to Drought Condition Analysis using SPI and SPEI Index data, Rainfall forecasting on the basis of weather-related variables using machine learning and time series forecasting algorithms.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and working on the Latest frameworks and large language models for creating Generative and Agentic AI Applications.
