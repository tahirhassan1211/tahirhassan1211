## Hi there üëã I am Tahir Hassan

## About Me
**I'm a passionate Machine Learning and Generative AI developer focused on building scalable and impactful solutions using the latest AI technologies. In 2024, I completed MS in Data Science from NED University of Engineering and Technology, along with two research publications in IEEE international conferences. Before that, I had completed a BS in Computer Science from FAST National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences.


- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on research projects related to Drought Condition Analysis using SPI and SPEI Index data, as well as rainfall forecasting based on weather-related variables using machine learning and time series forecasting algorithms.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning and working on the Latest frameworks and large language models for creating Generative and Agentic AI Applications. 

## Projects
- ### RAG-Based Student Assistant for Textbook Application
  This app can be used for getting assistance related to textbook chapters. It helps students in extracting chapter-wise relevant information insights, generating chapter summary and generating relevant descriptive, MCQ based, true& false and Fill in the Blanks questions.
  Deployed application link: https://student-assistance-chatbot.streamlit.app/
- ### Text Sentiment Analyzer Application.
  This application can be used to analyze the sentiment of given text. In this project, I have applied a distilbert-based pretrained model by using it from the Huggingface Transformers library. The frontend of the app is created using Gradio. Deployed application link: https://huggingface.co/spaces/tahirhassan9119/Text-Sentiment-Analyzer
